Write user-friendly release notes with a creative title.

FORMAT - Your output MUST start with this exact line format:
# $version - <Creative Title>

Where <Creative Title> is 2-6 words capturing the theme of the release (e.g., "Secrets Stay Secret", "Provider Paradise", "Better Error Messages").
For smaller or less impactful releases, keep the title understated and modest.

TONE CALIBRATION:
- Match the tone and length to the actual significance of the changes
- If the release is mostly small bug fixes or minor tweaks, be upfront about that—a sentence or two of summary is fine, don't write multiple paragraphs inflating the importance
- Reserve enthusiastic, detailed write-ups for releases with genuinely significant features or changes
- It's okay to say "This is a smaller release focused on bug fixes" when that's the case

After the title line, write the release notes:
1. Start with a summary proportional to the significance of the changes
2. Organize into ### sections (Highlights, Bug Fixes, etc.)
3. Explain WHY changes matter to users
4. Include PR links and documentation links (https://fnox.jdx.dev/)
5. Include contributor usernames (@username). Do not thank @jdx since that is who is writing these notes.
6. Skip internal changes

Write your output to the file: ${output_file}
Do not output anything else — just write to the file.
