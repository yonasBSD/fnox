//! Resolved provider configuration types.
//!
//! This module provides additional methods for `ResolvedProviderConfig`.
//! The enum itself is now generated from providers/*.toml files.

// Re-export the generated type from mod.rs
// (ResolvedProviderConfig is already exported from mod.rs via generated::providers_config)
